    <p>Fashion design is the <b>art</b> of <b>applying design, aesthetics,</b> clothing construction and natural beauty to <b>clothing</b> and its <b>accessories.</b> It is influenced by culture and different trends and has varied over time and place. "A fashion designer creates clothing, including dresses, suits, pants, and skirts, and accessories like shoes and handbags, for consumers. They can specialize in clothing, accessory, or <b>jewelry</b> design, or may work in more than one of these areas."</p><hr>
